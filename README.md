# SlickText Evaluation Project

## Users
The class which defines the User model is: `App/Models/User.php`.

## Database
1. Create a database for the project, and create the users table as provided in the supplied project notes.
2. For the simplicity of the eval, simply plug the db credentials into the \App\Models\DB __construct() method. Usually, these would be in an environment file so that each instance could use distinct parameters.


## Notes
The document root of the project is: `public/`
